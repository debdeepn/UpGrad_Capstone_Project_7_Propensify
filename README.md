Description of the two python notebooks:

1. Propensify_train: 

Used to perform EDA, Data Cleaning, Balancing Imbalanced Data, Feature Engineering, Model Selection, Model Training, and Model Validation
                       
All the encoders, transformers, and any other objects (Columns names along with their order, functions, etc) which draws inference from the training process,
and needs to retain the same information for creating the data pre-processing pipeline for new/test data, is saved in the folder called "model_folder" at the end of this code.

2. Propensify_predict:

Reads the new/test data, and applies the same data pre-processing pipeline that was used on the training dataset by utilizing the files stored in the folder called "model_folder".
The code outputs a file called "output_fromApp" which contains an additional column called "Will respond?" depicting whether or not a lead will make a purchase/convert to a customer 
if marketting efforts are directed towards him/her.

How to use the model to make predictions?

1. Data attributes required in the "test.xlsx" file to make predictions:
   custAge, profession, marital, schooling, default, housing, loan, contact, month, day_of_week, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome, emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx, euribor3m,     nr.employed, pmonths, pastEmail, id

2. Bundle the above attributes for potential leads in an excel file, name it "test.xlsx", place it in the same folder as the trained model (Propensify_predict), and run the model.

3. The file "output_fromApp.xlsx" generated by the model will contain an additional column called "Will respond?" which will give you the prediction whether or not a potential lead will 
make a puchase (and therefore convert to a customer)
